  - filtering games with tag filter
    - even tags that do not exist
  - ignore comments
  - ignore variations
  - ignore comments and variations
- it's possible to read the file char by char without read_line?
- bin:
  - add argument --elo ELO which means a minimum elo for both players
  - add argument --standard which means initial position and known result (!= *)
  - when --notags is specified, tags must be read only if to tags filter is specified
